# OT-Lab-1 - Assembly Patterns
In this lab, you will learn the basic concepts of binary file disassembly, memory protection mechanisms and program debugging techniques. Then you will learn various methods of compiling executable files, learn binary linking, learn how to recreate assembly code or use reverse engineering techniques to crack the simplest program.
